<blockquote style="text-align: center;">
    
    In twilight’s glow, the spirits rise,  
    Beneath the moon and painted skies.  
    Petals fall like whispered dreams,  
    Where life and death entwine in streams.  

    Ahri’s charm and Thresh’s chain,  
    Echoes of joy, sorrow, and pain.  
    A festival where souls unite,  
    In blossoms’ glow, eternal light.
